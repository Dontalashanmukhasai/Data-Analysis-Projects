Election Ad Spending Analysis with Matplotlib:
As we are highly active on Facebook and Instagram, we must have seen ads based on elections by any of the political parties, especially BJP and INC. All the parties in India usually spend a lot of money on election campaigns. I recently collected data from Data analyst influencer about how much money was spent on Instagram and Facebook ads by each political party during the Indian elections 2024 in each state. In this article, we perform elections ad spending analysis using Matplotlib and how it impacted the voting patterns.

Elections Ad Spending Analysis: Dataset Overview
The dataset I have collected contains three files:

The Advertisers Dataset provides insights into which pages (parties or organizations) spend money on election ads and the volume of ads they run.
The Locations Dataset shows how much money was spent on ads in different locations, indicating where the campaigns were focusing their efforts.
The Results Dataset provides actual voting data, showing how many people voted in each area and the percentage of voter turnout
